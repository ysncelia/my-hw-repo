### ***Project 3 Feedback***

**Overall:**  
Great work on this assignment! You effectively explained all your outputs, metrics, and models. I appreciated all of the additional plotting, it really helps you get a 'feel' for your data! Also, nice work scaling your data. It's very interesting that actually shifted your probabilities. As you can see, you actually learned a slightly different model. I have a hunch that's due to the method of scaling (the QuantileTransformer). If you had used a StandardScaler, the results may be slightly closer to what the solutions had. No matter! Your results preserve the intuitive end.

I don't have much advice other than that I suggest you try out some different models! As you will see in class, and in your final project, different models learn in vastly different ways. Thus, building different models will yield slightly different results and interpretations!
