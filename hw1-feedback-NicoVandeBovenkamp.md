**Overall:** Great job on this assignment! Your answers were clear, organized, and well thought out. Don't have many points to make on it!


**Some Notes**

* *Q.3b* Remember that you can always apply some statistical tests for more concrete analysis. 

**Something to think about**


KDNuggets has a ton of nice post -- definitely a website to explore if you haven't already. Check out this one for [outlier analysis](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/02/removing-outliers-standard-deviation-python.html) in Python!

***Note: Given you already have some solid exposure to statistical/data analysis, if you ever feel a topic is too elementary or you want more, please ask for some suggestions for more advanced readings! I can send things your way, especially once we get into modeling!***
