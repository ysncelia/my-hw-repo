***Project 1: Housing Price Prediction***  
Awesome dataset, and a great problem to try and solve! Not much to comment here upfront!


***Project 2: YouTube Modeling***  
Another great project! I am glad you found this data. You are right, there are tons of ways you could approach this project. You could do a recommendation engine. You could also predict video views or likes or shares. You could do so many things! Depending on what you think is best, and that you have in the data, you could do any one of the above! You will likely have to define this in part 2, if you decide to use it. This will also be a good project for practicing some data cleaning, scraping, and aggregating!


***Project 3: Spotify Song Attributes***  
I have very few comments on this one either! The data is there, well organized, and the problem is straightforward!
