### ***Design Write-up Feedback***

An awesome project! This is a really cool project from both a context and technical perspective.

***Sentiment***  
In this context, sentiment analysis will be fairly challenging. Unless you got a collection of comments or the video content, your 'sentiment' will basically be the combination of likes, dislikes, and maybe number of comments.

***Having a Narrow Scope***  
Before you dive in, I would recommend that you narrow down your goal a bit to start. Pick on of the problems, maybe clustering, and start with investigating clusters of videos. From there, you will be able to answer some base questions. Then, you can move on to another base question and a subsequent model/technique to answer it!

***Time Series modeling***  
Another thing to consider is some form of time series modeling that focuses on the dislikes, comments, and likes over time. This could be a different way to approach the problem, which could be done on it's own _or_ in addition to the clustering work!
